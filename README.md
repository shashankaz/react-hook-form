## Features

- **Asynchronous Default Values**: Loads default values from an API asynchronously.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Implements field validation including custom and asynchronous validation logic.
- **Dynamic Field Arrays**: Supports adding and removing multiple phone numbers dynamically.
- **Form State Management**: Utilizes `react-hook-form` for efficient form state management.
- **DevTools Integration**: Includes `@hookform/devtools` for debugging and inspecting form state.
